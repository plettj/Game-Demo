            <h1>Title of the game goes here.</h1>
            <p>Day 1: Get an HTML, CSS, and Script file for everyone's projects;
            Link them to their GitHub accounts; and create a simple HTML document.
            Also, learn how CSS position properties work (specifically, 'absolute',
            not 'relative' or float much), link the css and js with the index.html,
            and use basic JavaScript to draw an image on the canvas that we created in html
            and styled in CSS. 
            </p>
            <p>Day 2: Once everyone's images can draw, we're gonna try to make some
            extremely basic javascript animation of whatever image tileset they make
            using Pixilart.com. The game will also have an animation loop and a gamestep
            function using requestAnimationFrame. Today, we decide which kind of game
            each person will be doing, since that will affect what we learn next:
            Objects (And if we are insanely productive: Physics).</p>
            <p>Day 3: Explain OBJECTS and show them console.log() so they can test out 
            random things to get to know objects.</p>
            <p>Day 4: Use objects as actual entities in the game; make an avatar object with
            methods that make him able to be animated, and move according to key events.</p>
            <p>Day 5: Teaching method has been revised: everyone will make a simple top-down
            "puzzle" game that has an avatar object along with a map object that holds the
            information for each level, and can draw that information to the canvas. Goals for
            the day include 4-way controls, and if time, map object, and if more time, 2D
            array to hold each level.</p>
            <p>Day 6: Created a map object with a 2D array that can hold each level and
            various methods for adding levels and starting levels. Revised avatar controls to
            run unit-by-unit, snapping to grid and listening properly to keyboard events.</p>
            <p>Day 7: Plan to get started with some simple UI in HTML and CSS. Since I am
            away the next day, I'll do my best to show things that the dudes can improve on
            themselves while I'm not around like UI design, as well as catch Kevin up since
            he missed last day.</p>
